== Node halt can fail on HA pairs with multiple SVMs

If you plan to halt or reboot a Cloud Volumes ONTAP node in an HA pair that has multiple storage VMs (SVMs), we recommend that you pre-migrate all logical interfaces (LIFs) to the partner node before shutting down the node.

The following example migrates all data LIFs from the current (local) node:

`node1::> network interface migrate-all -node local`

This action expediates the network transition to the partner node and avoids occasional known problems with stopping the node.

If the node can't be stopped because it takes too much time to migrate the LIFs, a retry of the reboot or halt command should make it stop.
